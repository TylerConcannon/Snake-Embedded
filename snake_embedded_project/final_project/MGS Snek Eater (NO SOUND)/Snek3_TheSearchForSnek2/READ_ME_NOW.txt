Dr. Byrnes,

Just a little note about running the project on the board. The images were causing a segmentation fault, so they were removed from the (NO_SOUND) project. Also, a version exists with no sound because the multimedia library is not loaded up onto the beaglebone. Due to time constraints and the fact that we all have several other projects to complete, we decided to simply omit the features from the board version (NO_SOUND) so we could go to bed before 4 a.m. If you want to get the full experience of Metal Gear Solid: Snek Eater, run the regular version on the debian vm or a compatible version of qt creator elsewhere.
